# A variable is a name which holds the data and allocates the some memory
# with the variable we can store data and access and manipulate the data

# variable  assigned  value
#    emp_id      =        22
# Every Programming language has a data type so as there variable has too
# Python is dynamically typed  programming language no need to specifiy the data type every time
# In python we need to specify 
# 1) Name of the Variable
# 2) Assign value to variable

# Syntax
# name_of_variable = value
# example
age = 10
print(age)
# Important Points
# 1) Variables names must be on the L.H.S
# 2) Value should be on the R.H.S
# example
# 1)Valid Cases
name = 'Python'
print(name)
number = 10
print(number) 
# 2) Invalid Cases
# 2 = emp_id
# print(emp_id)
# 100 = number
# print(number)   

# Multiple variable
# multiple variables can be assigned to multiple values in single line
# during the assignment variables must be on the L.H.S and must be equal to R.H.S by asignment oprator
# Example 1
a,b,c  = 10,20,30
print(a,b,c)
#  Single Value for multiple variables
# Example 2
a=b=c=40
print(a,b,c)

# Reintilize variable
# Variables can be reintialized or reused but the old values will be replaced with new ones
# Example 3
a = 20
print(a)

a = 40
print(b)
