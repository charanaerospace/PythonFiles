# The complex number represent the nuber written in the form of a+bj
# a is the real part of the number
# b is imaginary part of the number
# the small j or J after b indicates the square root of -1
# the part of a nd b may be floats

# Note if we compare two complex values  <,>,<=,>= operators will get errors
# Example
a = 3+6j
b = 6+2j
c =2+5j
# prints a,b,c
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
# prints typr of a,b,c
print()    #print includes a blank space
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
