# 3 types of operators
# 1)And
# 2)Or
# 3)Not

# Case Study
# Here
# the  variable a is true and 
# variable is b
# Using AND Operator
# a and b returns A  if A is False
# a and b returns B if A is not False
# logical boolean operators
# And
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)
# Or
print(a or b)
# not
print(not a)
# a and b returns A  if A is False
# a and b returns B if A is not False
# logical boolean operators
c = 0
d = 10
print(c and d)
e = 5
f = 10
print(e and f)
