# A variables is  a reserved memory area to store a value
# A variable  is  a value that varies according to the condition
# Every variable is treated as an object in python  
# A variable can be mutale or immutable
# If the value of the variable changes then it is called mutable
# Value deos not change then it is immutable
# We can assign a value to the variable at that time  variable is created
# we can use assignment operator
# the oerand on the left of assignment operator is variable and on right hand side is value
# variable      assignment   operator value
# variable_name    =         variable_value
#    name            =            'chari'
#    age             =               25
#    salary          =               25000   
# Changing The value of the variable
# Python is a dynamically typed language not subjected to the data type restriction
# A var my be assigned to value of one type  and reassigned to value f different type
# Example
a = 10
# print var
print(a)
# print type of var
print(type(a))
# Reassigning the different value
a = 55
# print var
print(a)
# type of var
print(type(a))

# changing the value to string
a = 'Python course'
# print var
print(a)
# print type of var
print(type(a))

# changing the value to float
a = 369.56
# print var
print(a)
# print type of a
print(type(a))
